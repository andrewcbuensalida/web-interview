## Overview

You should:

- provide an overview of how you approached this challenge
npm uninstall node-sass
npm install node-sass@4.14.1
because when doing yarn build, it gave an incompatibility error from node-sass 5 to 4.



- explain any trade-offs you made here, for example if you decided to take less time on the styling so you could concentrate on tests
- explain what you would have done next, for example you might decide to write more tests or spend more time on styling

## General Feedback
