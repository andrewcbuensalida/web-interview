# NOTES

## How long did it take?
20 hours give or take.

## Overview

You should:

- provide an overview of how you approached this challenge.
First I read the README.md to find out what the requirements are, such as building an API, availability filtering, form validation, mobile responsive etc..
Second, I examined all the files to get a general overview of the app.
I looked at the picture of the demo, and imagined how the user would use the app. 
Because I usually use npm, I researched how to use yarn. It turns out that they are very similar. 
After trying to install the dependencies, a few of them were deprecated, for example I had to revert the version of node-sass.
I don't usually use json-server so I had to research on that.
After I got it to run, fixed some simple logical errors like switching the i and j variables in the for loops. I started from the top and worked my way down. I started with the business logic, such as filtering slots by consultant type, and then started styling. Then I added some special features like the drag scrolling of the buttons with a faded effect. Now I am currently deploying to AWS.

- explain any trade-offs you made here, for example if you decided to take less time on the styling so you could concentrate on tests
I tried to spend equal time on styling and logic. The tests I did were just console.logging.

- explain what you would have done next, for example you might decide to write more tests or spend more time on styling
I would integrate user sign in with Google and possibly integrating with a database.

## General Feedback

- Is there anything we need to improve or make clearer?
